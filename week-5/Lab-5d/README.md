# `Lab-5d`: Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata Simulation
The objectives of `lab-5d` are to familiarize students with the concept of cellular automata and to develop a simple two-dimensional cellular automata simulation. Cellular automata are discrete models studied in computer science, physics, and mathematics. They are used to model complex systems and to study the behavior of systems that evolve over time. In particular, cellular automata are used to model the behavior of cells in a biological system, the behavior of particles in a physical system, and the behavior of agents in a computer science system.
