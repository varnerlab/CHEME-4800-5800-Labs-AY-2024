# `Lab-5d`: Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata Simulation
The objectives of `lab-5d` are to familiarize students with the concept of cellular automata and to develop a simple two-dimensional cellular automata simulation. Cellular automata are discrete models studied in computer science, physics, and mathematics. They are used to model complex systems such as the behavior of cells in a biological system, the behavior of particles in a physical system, and the behavior of agents in a computer science system.
