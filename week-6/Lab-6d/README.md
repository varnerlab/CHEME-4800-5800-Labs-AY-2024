# Lab 7d: Depth-First and Breadth-First Tree and Graph Traversal
Tree and graph traversal algorithms are fundamental to computer science. They are used to explore, search, and sort data. In this lab, you will implement two of the most common traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search.
* Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices by following a path as far as it can go before backtracking. DFS is often used to detect cycles in a graph, and it is also used to generate mazes and to solve puzzles.
* Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices in the order of their distance from the source vertex, where distance is the minimum length of a path from the source vertex to the target vertex. BFS is complete and optimal for unweighted graphs, and it is often used to find the shortest path between two vertices.
