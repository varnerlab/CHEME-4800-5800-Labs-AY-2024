# Introduction
This repository holds the lab codes for the [CHEME 4800/5800 Computational Thinking Course at Cornell](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-4800-5800-ComputingBook/landing.html).

## Overview
Engineering practice increasingly relies on computational tools and data analysis approaches. This one-semester course introduces computational thinking into engineering analysis. We integrate data science and statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematical modeling approaches into the context of contemporary problems in the design and analysis of processes, products, and systems. The course is agnostic to platforms and tools; we’ll focus on paradigms, not syntax. However, we’ll use the [Julia](https://julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) programming languages and their associated toolchain when transitioning from idea to implementation. In addition, we’ll use cloud computing resources for course materials, assignments, and projects. Weekly labs provide guided practice on the computer, with teaching staff present. Course assignments use data sets and examples to develop fluency and understanding of real-life problems. 

* CHEME 4800 will co-meet with CHEME 5800. Students in CHEME 4800 will attend the same lectures and lab sections and complete the same problem sets as CHEME 5800. However, students in CHEME 5800 will have a significantly more in-depth team project.
