    "`Lab 14b` will familiarize students with using `value iteration` for solving a two-dimensional grid-world navigation task. Suppose you have a [roomba](https://www.irobot.com) that has finished cleaning the floor in your kitchen and needs to return to its charging station (where it receives a positive reward). However, between your kitchen and the `charging station` (home base and safety), there are one or more `lava pits` (destruction for the [roomba](https://www.irobot.com), large negative reward). \n",

    "* An reward $R_{a}\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ is received after transitioning from $s\\rightarrow{s}^{\\prime}$ due to action $a$. \n",
    "* The state transition model $T_{a}\\left(s,s^{\\prime}\\right) = P(s_{t+1} = s^{\\prime}~|~s_{t}=s,a_{t} = a)$ denotes the probability that action $a$ in state $s$ at time $t$ will result in state $s^{\\prime}$ at time $t+1$\n",
    "* The quantity $\\gamma$ is a discount factor used to weigh the future expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a policy function $\\pi$ is the mapping from states $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$ to actions $a\\in\\mathcal{A}$ used by the agent to solve a decision task, i.e., $\\pi(s) = a$. \n",
