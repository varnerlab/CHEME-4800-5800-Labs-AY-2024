# Lab 12d: Estimate an Optimal Stock Allocation using Cobb-Douglas Utility Maximization and Simulated Annealing
`Lab 12d` will familirize students with the concept of Cobb-Douglas utility maximization and simulated annealing. Students will use these concepts to estimate an optimal stock allocation in portfilio $\mathcal{P}$, where we will assume that the utility function is given by the Cobb-Douglas utility function:

$$
U(n_1, n_2, \dots, n_{P}) = \prod_{i\in\mathcal{P}} n_i^{\gamma_i}
$$

where $n_i$ is number of shares invested in stock $i$, and $\gamma_i$ is the coefficient of stock $i$ in the utility function. The goal is to find the optimal stock allocation that maximizes the utility function, subject to a budget constraint of the form:

$$
\sum_{i\in\mathcal{P}} {n_i}\cdot{S_i} = B
$$

where $S_i$ is the share price of stock $i$, and $B$ is the budget. We will use simulated annealing to estimate the optimal stock allocation where we assume a budget of $B=1000$ `USD` and a model of $\gamma_i$ of the form:

$$
\gamma_i = \max(0,\,\frac{\mathbb{E(R_{i})}}{\beta_{i}})
$$

where $\mathbb{E}(R_{i})$ is the expected excess return of stock $i$, and $\beta_{i}$ is the $\beta$-parameter for stock $i$. 

## Tasks
1. __Duration 20 min__: Read the [Simulated Annealing material on our online notes](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-4800-5800-ComputingBook/unit-3-learning/combitorial.html#simulated-annealing).
1. __Duration 10 min__: Finish the implementation of the `runme_task_2.jl` script that computes the [single index model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-index_model) for each stock in the [SP500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500) index. See `Lab 10b`. The solution for this task is provided in the `solutions` folder.
2. __Duration 10 min__: In the `runme_task_3.jl` script, construct a `MySimulatedAnnealingProblem` instance with `number_of_iterations = 100`,
`number_of_iterations_per_T = 100`, `Î± = 0.999` and `bounds = bounds`.
3. __Duration 10 min__: Execute the `testme_task_3.jl` script. Do you get the expected output, i.e., pass the tests?
    - This script calls the `runme_task_3.jl` script and checks if the output is as expected, i.e., the budget constraint is satisfied and we compute the objective function correctly.
